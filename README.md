# About
This is based from the official documentation of godot ["Your First Game"](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/blob/master/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.rst), which only supports C# and GDscript. The game was written on C++ with the help of GDExtension -- A Dynamic library that provides the essential godot classes which helps you bridge Godot nodes and your C++ codes--. My version does not perfectly adhere to the original documentation logic, especially on the UI part of the game. The game only runs on the editor, no executable file provided.

# Purpose
The purpose of this is to understand the fundamentals of C++, particularly pointers, reference, headers, OOP, namespace, heap, stacks, and C++ build process.
